# Epidemic_Simulation
Epidemic Simulation is an open-source project that aims to provide an interactive and educational tool for simulating the spread of a virus in a 2D plane. The project utilizes various parameters such as transmission rate, infection period, and recovery rate to generate different scenarios of an epidemic. The simulation tool is designed to visualize the epidemic in real-time, enabling users to observe the spread of the virus and the impact of various interventions such as quarantine, social distancing, and vaccination. The project aims to educate users about the importance of public health measures and the impact of individual behavior on the spread of an epidemic. Epidemic Simulation is built using Python and is available on GitHub for anyone to use, modify, and contribute to.
